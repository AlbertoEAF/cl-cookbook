Thanks for contributing to the Cookbook. Please follow these
guidelines. Some are only a convention, some are important for epub
generation.

- the first section in a chapter should be a subsection: `## title` (indeed, the section name in the epub is the chapter name).
- use `~~~lisp` for code snippets.
- code snippets must be preceded and followed by a newline:

```

Here's a snippet:

~~~lisp
(defun oh ())
~~~

This snippet...
```
