;; Compile a region by selecting the first 2 forms in test-all and
;; running M-x slime-compile-region.

;; Compile a defun by putting the cursor inside the "test-format"
;; defun and pressing "C-c C-e".

;; Compile the sexp before the point by putting the cursor after the
;; closing paren of "(test-format)" and pressing "C-c C-e".

;; To evaluate rather than compile:
;; - evaluate a region with "C-c C-r",
;; - evaluate a defun with "C-M-x",
;; - evaluate the sexp before the point with "C-x C-e".
;; See also other commands in the menu.
